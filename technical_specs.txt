The original game uses 28 different colors, but only 16 different
colors for sprites, which is good!

So the amiga display uses 32 colors but only 16 colors are assigned
to BOBs which saves some blitting.
The stars are originally sprites, but now converted to a 
single pixel on only 1 bitplane, which makes drawing super-fast.
The possible colors range from white to blue (5 colors) so by using
palette entries 1,2,4,8,16 it's possible to display them with a single
BSET instruction (and clear them with a simple CLR.B)

The fonts/tiles use the rest of the colors, so they're displayed
using the 5 bitplanes.

Display is double-buffered

The game detects when there are fonts/planets in the middle of the
playfield, and uses blit clear instead of background restore
(which is the active mode when playing)

The game uses the blitter to clear the sprites, and the CPU when the blitter
is busy.

When the game has to blit a 3 plane BOB (with an empty plane) the empty
plane is skipped altogether, and it's not noticable as there is not a lot
of overlap between BOBs of different kinds.

Roondar audio mixer is used to output the sfx only on one channel, leaving
other 3 channels for music

No copper tricks or hardware sprites are used.

Enabling 25 FPS and turning off the starfield allows the game to run at decent
speed on a low specs machine.
