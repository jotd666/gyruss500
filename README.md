Features:

- more sfx at a time than the original (thanks to audio mixing
  routine)
- Better cheats than MAME (level select, invincibility)

  the game to run at a decent speed on A500/7Mhz (but A1200 is recommended)

There are 2 versions of the game. The 1MB version runs on 1MB amigas
but there will be no music.
The 2MB version runs on 1.5 MB amigas, with full sounds & music

Fastmem is recommended for smoother gameplay.
