- missing sounds in highscore entry (letter input 0X17 + 0x18 end)
- player shoot sound accumulates not very nicely
- increase sound volume
- test with 1MB
- missing warp sound to planet sfx, missing iceberg sound
- sound globally increase volume
- clear bitplane note the zero bitplanes to avoid clearing the bitplanes: doesn't work properly
- handle loop (radio): when to stop it? maybe if sound 0 played
  then stop loops and music (not regular SFX)
  
- invincivility: ok except for some rare cases to investigate: factorize the part F0 => 9000
- missing sounds: flash yellow but add ignored sound flag
- make degraded version for A500, maybe 8k sfx and no music?
  (and better sfx for others!)

bpset 3831,,{PC=$3803;g}
and reset

turn off sprite semaphore/sync:

bpset f0cd:sub,,{PC=$F0CF;g}

turn off music 25/27 and background humming:

bpset 5c38,a==$25 || a==$27 || a == $2,{PC=$3803;g}
bpset 5c38,a==$25 || a==$27 || a == $2 || a == $a,{PC=$3803;g}

log sounds:

bpset 5c38,,{printf "%x",A;g}

- to redirect "credit" sound to any sound
bpset 5c38,,{A=xxx;g}
