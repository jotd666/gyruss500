- clear bitplane note the zero bitplanes to avoid clearing the bitplanes: doesn't work properly
- player_explosion/killed: retry
- award double shot: not loud enough retry
- levels seem not in sequence (maybe just with level select)

- invincivility: ok except for some rare cases to investigate: factorize the part F0 => 9000
- make degraded version for A500, maybe 8k sfx and no music?
  (and better sfx for others!)
 


---------------------

to turn off stars:

bpset 3804,,{PC=$3803;g}
bpset 3831,,{PC=$3803;g}
and reset

turn off sprite semaphore/sync:

bpset f0cd:sub,,{PC=$F0CF;g}

turn off music 25/27 and background humming:

bpset 5c38,a==$25 || a==$27 || a == $2,{PC=$3803;g}
bpset 5c38,a==$25 || a==$27  || a==$28 || a==$29 | a == $2 || a == $a,{PC=$3803;g}

log sounds:

bpset 5c38,,{printf "%x",A;g}

- to redirect "credit" sound to any sound
bpset 5c38,,{A=xxx;g}
